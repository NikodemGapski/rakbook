# Rakbook

Rakbook is a website made by studens for students of "mat-inf 2019 (3 years)" from Uniwersyteckie Liceum Ogólnokształcące, mainly as class-mail, because usual solution with account on gmail with same password for everyone was not good enough.

## Features
+ announcements
+ class-mail
+ students on duty
+ quotes from teachers
+ memes
+ homework list
+ Nodzu-soundboard
+ nick colors shop
+ administration panel
+ API

## Instalation

### Simple

Copy files from `www` folder to your website main directory, import database from `database.sql`, change `dbcredentials.php` to match your database configuration, change `mailmanagement.php` to match your mail server configuration, give administrator rights to first administrator by manually editing relevant database cell and you are good to go!

Auto clone and docker in the future??

## Support

If you somehow found us and for unknown reason want to use our code - be our guest! Feel free to post issues. Because Rakbook was made for polish school, all text is in polish, but we can translate it if you want - just let us know.

## Contributing

Any help will be appreciated. We suggest installing local web server (like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)) on your computer for testing.
